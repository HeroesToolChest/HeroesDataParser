```

Example command to create xml and json files from the `Heroes of the Storm` directory. Since no `-o|--output-directory` option is set, it defaults to the local directory.
```
dotnet heroesdata.dll 'D:\Heroes of the Storm' -e hero
```

**Note: When using command prompt on windows, use double quotes instead of single quote when specifying filepaths.**

## Validation Warnings
All the warnings do not need to be fixed, they are shown for awareness.  
Tooltip strings that fail to parse will show up as `(╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻ [Failed to parse]` in the xml or json files.  
Warnings can be shown to the console using the option `--warnings`.  
Ignored warnings are in `verifyignore.txt`.  
Ignored warnings only work for a majority of english strings.  

## Arguments
### Storage Path
There are two types of paths that can be provided for this argument. One is the `Heroes of the Storm` directory and the other is an already extracted `mods` directory.

If this option is not provided, it will look for the `Heroes of the Storm` files in the local directory or an extracted `mods` directory.

The `extract` command is available to use to extract the mods directory and all required files.

The `mods` directory can also have a build suffix in its name. [More info](https://github.com/koliva8245/HeroesDataParser/tree/master#mods-suffix-directory).

## Options
### Output Directory (-o|--output-directory)
If this option is not provided, it will default to the install directory under the directory `output`.
 
***
 
### Description (-d|--description)
Sets the description/tooltip output type (0 - 6).  
 - Default is 0 and is the recommended choice as it can be parsed to suit multiple verbiage
 - 5 is the other recommended choice, as it is the ingame verbiage

Some of these may require parsing for a readable output. Visit the [wiki page](https://github.com/koliva8245/HeroesDataParser/wiki/Parsing-Descriptions) for parsing tips.

`0` - RawDescription (Default)  
The raw output of the description. Contains the color tags `<c val=\"#TooltipNumbers\"></c>`, scaling data `~~x~~`, and newlines `<n/>`.

Example:  
```
Fires a laser that deals <c val=\"#TooltipNumbers\">200~~0.04~~</c> damage.<n/>Does not affect minions.
```

`1` - PlainText  
Plain text without any color tags, scaling info, or newlines.  Newlines are replaced with a double space.

Example:  
```
Fires a laser that deals 200 damage.  Does not affect minions.
```

`2` - PlainTextWithNewlines  
Same as PlainText but contains newlines.

Example:  
```
Fires a laser that deals 200 damage.<n/>Does not affect minions.
```

`3` - PlainTextWithScaling  
Same as PlainText but contains the scaling info `(+x% per level)`.

Example:  
```
Fires a laser that deals 200 (+4% per level) damage.  Does not affect minions.
```

`4` - PlainTextWithScalingWithNewlines  
Same as PlainTextWithScaling but contains the newlines.

Example:  
```
Fires a laser that deals 200 (+4% per level) damage.<n/>Does not affect minions.
```

`5` - ColoredText  
Contains the color tags and newlines. When parsed, this is what appears ingame for tooltips.

Example:  
```
Fires a laser that deals <c val=\"#TooltipNumbers\">200</c> damage.<n/>Does not affect minions.
```

`6` - ColoredTextWithScaling  
Same as ColoredText but contains the scaling info.

Example:  
```
Fires a laser that deals <c val=\"#TooltipNumbers\">200 (+4% per level)</c> damage.<n/>Does not affect minions.
```

  --textures                        Includes extracting all textures (.dds).
```

Extracts all required files from the `Heroes of the Storm` directory which can be used for the `storage-path` argument.  

If the `-o|--output-directory` is not set, the local directory will be used.

A `mods` directory will always be created as the base directory.

Example command that will extract all required files including the textures.
```
extract 'D:\Games\Heroes of the Storm' --textures
```

***

### Image
```
Usage:  image [arguments] [options]

Arguments:

  file-path  The filepath of the file or directory to convert

Options:
  -?|-h|--help            Show help information
  -o|--output <FILEPATH>  Output directory to save the converted files to.
```
Converts a pre-version 4 hero-data xml or json into the version 4 format. This does not add any data.  It simply modifies the shortname, CHeroId, and CUnitId.

Example command
```
v4-convert '.\hero-data.xml'
```

## Advanced Features
### Mods suffix directory
The `mods` directory may have a `_<build number>` suffix in its name. The build number determines the overrides file(s) to load. If the overrides file does not exist and the build number is greater than the highest overrides file then it will load the default overrides file otherwise it will load next **lowest** overrides file.

Example:
```
directory to load: mods_13500

hero overrides files:
hero-overrides.xml
hero-overrides_12000.xmls
hero-overrides_13000.xml <--- will be loaded
hero-overrides_14000.xml

directory to load: mods_14100

hero overrides files:
hero-overrides.xml <--- will be loaded
hero-overrides_12000.xml
hero-overrides_13000.xml 
hero-overrides_14000.xml
```

***

### Multi-mods directory
There can be multiple mods directories with the suffix `_<build number>` in the same directory.  If the selected parent directory is the storage path, the highest build number suffix diretory will be parsed.

For example, with this directory:
```
modFolders/
|--mods_22000/
   |--(FILES)
|--mods_22100/
   |--(FILES)
|--mods_22388/
   |--(FILES)
```
Setting `modFolders` as the storage path will have the `mods_22388` directory parsed.

***

### CASC DataOverrides loading
When using a `Heroes of the Storm` directory, it will load the equivalent overrides file(s) based on the build version, just like in the [mods suffix directory](https://github.com/koliva8245/HeroesDataParser/tree/master#mods-suffix-directory).

The override files are for manually modifying the data after parsing the game data.

***

## Developing
To build and compile the code, it is recommended to use the latest version of [Visual Studio 2019 or Visual Studio Code](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/).

Another option is to use the dotnet CLI tools from the [.NET Core 2.2 SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/windows).

The main project is `HeroesData.csproj` and the main entry point is `Program.cs`.

Both the `CASCLib.csproj` and `Heroes.Models.csproj` projects are submodules. Any code changes should be commited to those respective repositories.
